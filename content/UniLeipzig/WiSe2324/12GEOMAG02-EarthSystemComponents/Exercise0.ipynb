    "1. Geosphere: The geosphere is the solid Earth, including the crust, mantle, and core. It makes up the largest volume of the Earth. The Earth's radius is approximately 6,371 kilometers, and the entire Earth can be considered the geosphere. So, it represents nearly the entire volume of the Earth.\n",
    "2. Hydrosphere: The hydrosphere includes all the water on Earth, including oceans, rivers, lakes, and groundwater. Water covers about 71% of the Earth's surface. If we're looking at volume, water has a much lower density than rock, so it occupies a smaller fraction of the Earth's total volume compared to its surface area.\n",
    "3. Atmosphere: The Earth's atmosphere is relatively thin compared to the other spheres. It extends to an altitude of about 100 kilometers, but most of its mass is concentrated within the first 10-20 kilometers (troposphere). While the atmosphere extends quite high, it contains a relatively small fraction of the Earth's total mass and volume.\n",
    "4. Biosphere: The biosphere is the zone of life on Earth and includes all living organisms. It exists within the other spheres, so it doesn't have a distinct volume of its own. Life is found from the ocean depths to the highest mountains, and it is intimately connected with the hydrosphere, geosphere, and atmosphere."

Composed of the crust, mantle, and core, the geosphere constitutes the rocky foundation of our planet. The lithosphere, comprising the rigid outer layer, forms the continents and oceanic crust. Beneath it lies the asthenosphere, a semi-fluid layer, and further down, the Earth's dense core.\n",
    "The geosphere's vast mass, accounting for the majority of Earth's volume, influences the planet's gravitational pull and plays a crucial role in shaping its geological features. From towering mountains to expansive valleys, the geosphere represents the substantial bulk of our planet's physical composition."
